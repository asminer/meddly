    MDD library interface.

    This interface is enough for "casual" users, i.e., users
    who are happy to use only the built-in operations.
    There is also an "expert" interface for users who would
    like to define new operations (in fact, the built-in
    operations use this same interface).

    General naming principles:
    Class names are of the form class_name.
    Method names are of the form verbObjectDetails.
    Global functions have names prefixed with "MEDDLY_".

    A data structure for managing collections of functions
    (or sets, or vectors, or relations, or matrices,

    Some interesting features of forests:
    - The reduction rule can be different for different variables.
    - The storage rule can be different for different variables.
