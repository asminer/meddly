/** Interface for initializing Meddly's compute table(s).
    Note - this is a singleton class but this is not enforced.

    This is exposed here because it allows us to avoid a
    "chicken and egg" problem:  to initialize the library, we want to
    set the compute table style, but we cannot guarantee that those
    pointers are set up before we initialize the library.
    So, settings for compute tables should be made as follows.

    (1) call defaultInitializerList(), to build an instance of this class,
        and save the result.  That will set up the default settings.

    (2) change settings using static members

    (3) initialize Meddly using the saved initializer list.
