The online documentation lives in /docs, mostly as markdown files.
To preview the site before it goes live, do the following.


(1) Install Ruby and Ruby development, if needed

    Fedora:     # sudo dnf install ruby ruby-devel
    MacPorts:   # sudo port install ruby ruby-devel

(2) In the docs directory, run (as ordinary user)

    # bundle install --path vendor/bundle

(3) Start jekyll

    # bundle exec jekyll serve
