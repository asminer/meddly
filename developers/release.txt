Preferred mechanism to "release" the library:

(0) git commit and push

(1) Finalize any release notes in docs/_releases/unreleased.md

(2) Check "make install" headers/library by running ./checkInstall.sh

(3) Run ./Release.sh script, which automatically
    (a) updates version number in configure.ac
    (b) updates release documentation in docs/_releases,
        and docs/_data/navigation.yml
    (c) tags release

    Probably good to double-check these files.

(4) upload tarball sourceforge (under "Files")

(5) bask in the glory of a job well-done
