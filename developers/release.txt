Preferred mechanism to "release" the library:

(0) git commit and push

(1) Run ./Release script

(2) upload tarball sourceforge (under "Files")

(3) check new version in configure.ac

(4) add an entry in docs/_releases, and update
    docs/_data/navigation.yml

(5) bask in the glory of a job well-done
