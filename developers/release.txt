Preferred mechanism to "release" the library:

(0) git commit and push

(1) Finalize any release notes in docs/_releases/unreleased.md

(2) Run ./Release.sh script, which automatically
    (a) updates version number in configure.ac
    (b) updates release documentation in docs/_releases,
        and docs/_data/navigation.yml
    (c) tags release

    Probably good to double-check these files.

(3) upload tarball sourceforge (under "Files")

(4) bask in the glory of a job well-done
