Preferred mechanism to "release" the library:

(0) git commit and push

(1) Finalize any release notes in docs/_releases/unreleased.md

(2) Check that we can build applications from the "installed" headers
    and library, by running the following.
    (a) In the parent directory: rm include/meddly/* lib/*; make install
    (b) In this directory: run make

(3) Run ./Release.sh script, which automatically
    (a) updates version number in configure.ac
    (b) updates release documentation in docs/_releases,
        and docs/_data/navigation.yml
    (c) tags release

    Probably good to double-check these files.

(4) upload tarball sourceforge (under "Files")

(5) bask in the glory of a job well-done
