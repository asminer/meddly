<h2>New in Version 0.14.818 (2017 July 05)</h2>

<h3>Simple interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Class <tt>node_storage</tt> factory portion split into
  new class, <tt>node_storage_style</tt>.
  Interface updated.
  </li>

  <li>
  Forest policies must be constructed after library initialization,
  because node storage styles will not be known before this.
  A new empty constructor, and method <tt>useDefaults</tt>, have
  been added to class <tt>forest::policies</tt> to allow this.
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed error code <tt>OVERFLOW</tt> to <tt>VALUE_OVERFLOW</tt>
  to avoid name issues with math macro.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Expert interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Default policies for MDD and MXD forests moved from
  class <tt>settings</tt>
  to class <tt>forest</tt> as static members.
  This allows the defaults to be changed after library initialization.
  </li>

  <li>
  Initialization sequence has been removed from class <tt>settings</tt>,
  and is instead passed to the MEDDLY initialization function explicitly.
  </li>

  <li>
  Class <tt>op_initializer</tt> has been converted into
  a generic library initialization class, <tt>initializer_list</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>
  Class <tt>cleanup_procedure</tt> has been removed;
  use <tt>initializer_list</tt> instead.
  </li>

  <li>
  Compute table initialization is now handled by an initializer,
  class <tt>ct_initializer</tt>.
  The compute table settings have been moved from class <tt>settings</tt>,
  and into this new class.
  To change the default compute table settings, you should
  <ol>
    <li>
    Build and save the default initializer list, 
    using <tt>defaultInitializerList()</tt>.
    </li>

    <li>
    Change the compute table settings, using static methods of class
    <tt>ct_initializer</tt>.
    </li>

    <li>
    Initialize the library, using the initializer list that was saved
    in step 1.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
  The old class <tt>settings</tt> has been removed, 
  since it has become empty.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Node storage styles are now set up using an <tt>initializer_list</tt>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>New in Version 0.13.685 (2016 June 15)</h2>

<h3>Simple interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  New abstract interfaces for I/O (classes <tt>input</tt> and <tt>output</tt>)
  for all library I/O (except for internal debugging I/O).
  Use classes <tt>FILE_input</tt> and <tt>FILE_output</tt> for C-style
  <tt>FILE*</tt> I/O,
  and classes <tt>istream_input</tt> and <tt>ostream_output</tt>
  for C++-style <tt>iostream</tt> I/O.
  <tt>meddly.h</tt> now includes both <tt>cstdio</tt> and <tt>iostream</tt>.
  These can be disabled if necessary 
  by defining <tt>_MEDDLY_WITHOUT_CSTDIO_</tt>
  or <tt>_MEDDLY_WITHOUT_IOSTREAM_</tt>, respectively,
  before including <tt>meddly.h</tt>.
  </li>

</ul>
<h3>Expert interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Class <tt>node_reader</tt> is now class <tt>unpacked_node</tt>,
  and methods to initialize a node reader have been moved into
  the <tt>unpacked_node</tt> class.
  </li>

  <li>
  Class <tt>node_builder</tt> has been eliminated;
  all functionality has been moved to class <tt>unpacked_node</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>
  Class <tt>node_header</tt> is now a private inner class
  for class <tt>expert_forest</tt>;
  all access to node header information 
  should be through getter and setter helper functions.
  </li>

  <li>
  Prototype implementation of saturation on partitioned transition relations.
  See operation <tt>SATURATION_FORWARD</tt> and class
  <tt>satpregen_opname</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>
  Prototype implementation of on-the-fly saturation.
  See operation <tt>SATURATION_OTF_FORWARD</tt> and class
  <tt>satotf_opname</tt>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>  Fixed several bugs with node reference counts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>New in Version 0.12.625 (2015 April 25)</h2>

<h3>Simple interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  More careful and more strict use of
  <tt>set</tt> methods in class <tt>dd_edge</tt>:
  for multi-terminal forests, use <tt>set</tt>
  with a single argument;
  for edge-valued forsts, use the appropriate
  two-argument version of <tt>set</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>  Added new edge labeling possiblity, <tt>INDEX_SET</tt>.
        From now on, this should be used instead of <tt>EVPLUS</tt>
        whenever an indexed set is constructed
        with operation <tt>CONVERT_TO_INDEX_SET</tt>,
        otherwise the library will throw an exception.
  </li>

  <li> Added operations <tt>VM_MULTIPLY</tt>, <tt>MV_MULTIPLY</tt>
       and <tt>MM_MULTIPLY</tt> for MTMxDs.
  </li>

  <li> Changed design of the <tt>enumerator</tt> class.
       Regular enumerators can be initialized as usual (constructor
       with a <tt>dd_edge</tt>).
       Otherwise, use a constructor (or initialize later)
       by passing the enumeration type and forest.
       Note that now, the forest for an enumerator is fixed for its life.
  </li>

  <li> Added support for EV*MxDs.
  </li>

  <li> Added mechanism to log forest changes to a file,
       to be utilized by other utilities
       (see class <tt>logger</tt> within class <tt>forest</tt>).
  </li>
       
  <li> Cleaned up the header file.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Expert interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li> 
  Added classes <tt>int_EVencoder</tt> and <tt>float_EVencoder</tt>
  for a centralized mechanism for storing edge values within nodes.
  </li>

  <li> 
  Classes <tt>bool_encoder</tt>, <tt>int_encoder</tt>, and
  <tt>float_encoder</tt> have been renamed <tt>bool_Tencoder</tt>,
  <tt>int_Tencoder</tt>, and <tt>float_Tencoder</tt> for consistency.
  </li>

  <li> Vector-matrix and matrix-vector multiply can now use
       <tt>INDEX_SET</tt> or <tt>EVPLUS</tt> forests.
       Currently, it is better to use <tt>INDEX_SET</tt>
       forests if possible.
  </li>

  <li>  Changed names <tt>VECT_MATR_MULT</tt> and <tt>MATR_VECT_MULT</tt>,
  to <tt>EXPLVECT_MATR_MULT</tt> and <tt>MATR_EXPLVECT_MULT</tt>,
  to emphasize that vectors are stored explicitly.
  </li>

  <li>  Completely re-designed the compute table interface.
  Large impact on implementation of operations;
  little to no impact on everything else.
  The new interface completely hides the compute table
  storage mechanism, so we will be able to plug in different
  storage schemes without changing any operation code
  (at least, in theory).
  Part of the gradual shift toward 64-bit node handles.
  </li>

  <li> Class <tt>numerical_operation</tt> is removed and should be
       replaced by <tt>specialized_operation</tt>.
  </li>

  <li> Added a <tt>specialized_operation</tt> for saturation,
       which allows the use of partitioned transition relations
       with options for organizing and combining them.
       See class <tt>satpregen_opname</tt>,
       and <tt>SATURATION_FORWARD</tt>.
  </li>

  <li> Cleaned up the header file.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>  New implementation of <tt>COPY</tt>.
        It should now be possible to copy between almost any two 
        forests over the same domain
        (assuming they are either both for sets, or both for relations).
  </li>
  <li>  Added test applications for <tt>COPY</tt>, and EV*MxDs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>New in Version 0.11.486 (2014 February 04)</h2>

<h3>Simple interface</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Added <tt>const</tt> to array of terminal values,
       in parameter to <tt>createEdgeForVar</tt> methods.
       This should have minimal, if any, impact on applications.
  </li>

  <li> Added constants <tt>DONT_CARE</tt>
       and <tt>DONT_CHANGE</tt>,
       which should be used instead of raw values,
       for calls to <tt>createEdge()</tt> methods.
       In particular, <tt>DONT_CHANGE</tt> should <b>NOT</b>
       be used for unprimed levels.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Expert interface</h3>

<p>
The mechanism for encoding and decoding terminal nodes
(for multi-terminal forests) has been changed.
The following methods of <tt>expert_forest</tt> were removed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <tt>getBoolean()</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>getInteger()</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>getReal()</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>getTerminalNode()</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>isValidTerminalValue()</tt> </li>
</ul>
<p>
Terminal encoding is now handled by classes <tt>bool_encoder</tt>,
<tt>int_encoder</tt>, and <tt>float_encoder</tt>
inside <tt>expert_forest</tt>, allowing the use of templates if desired.
The following methods have been added for convenience:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <tt>handleForValue()</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>getValueFromHandle()</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>getBooleanFromHandle()</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>getIntegerFromHandle()</tt> </li>
  <li> <tt>getRealFromHandle()</tt> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Reorganized (and reimplemented) mutli-terminal hierarchy </li>
  <li> A few bug fixes </li>
</ul>


<h2>New in Version 0.10.456 (2013 July 30)</h2>

<ul>
<li> Added <tt>typedef</tt>s for node handles and addresses,
     updated the interface and code to use these.
</li>

<li> Switched to one pool of nodes per forest,
     instead of one pool per level.
</li>

<li> Changed free list representation for node handles.
</li>

<li>  The node storage mechanism is now loosely coupled,
      and may be selected at runtime.
</li>

<li>  The node memory recycling mechanism is now loosely coupled.
      There are a few mechanisms to choose from.
</li>

<li>  Added a new node storage mechanism that uses compression.
</li>

<li>  Added ability to read and write DDs to a file.
</li>

</ul>

<h4>SIMPLE INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> The forest policy for specifying full vs sparse node storage has changed.
     Now, this is specified via <tt>storage_flags</tt>
     by combining flags <tt>ALLOW_FULL_STORAGE</tt>
     and <tt>ALLOW_SPARSE_STORAGE</tt> as appropriate.
</li>
<li>  The node storage scheme may be changed on a per forest basis,
      at runtime, by setting the forest <tt>policy</tt> as appropriate
      (member <tt>nodestor</tt>).
</li>
<li>
      Removed forest policy <tt>recycleNodeStorageHoles</tt>,
      since the new policy <tt>nodestor</tt> 
      allows to specify how nodes are stored and how holes are
      tracked (if at all).
</li>
<li>  In the <tt>forest</tt> class, added methods
  <ul>
  <li>  <tt>writeEdges</tt>, to write one or more edges
        (and all nodes below) to a file in a machine readable format
  </li>
  <li>  <tt>readEdges</tt>, to read one or more edges
        (and all nodes below) from a file
  </li>
  </ul> 
</li>
</ul>

<h4>EXPERT INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> The node storage interface has changed.
     This is likely to affect forest implementations, and not much else.
</li>
<li>  Different node storage schemes are implemented in the
      <tt>storage</tt> subdirectory.
      Motivated users may invent and use their own schemes.
</li>
<li>  In the <tt>expert_forest</tt> class, method <tt>reportMemoryUsage</tt>
      has been replaced by method <tt>reportStats</tt>.
</li>
<li>  <tt>expert_forest::markNodesInSubgraph</tt> and
      <tt>expert_forest::showNodeGraph</tt>
      now take an array of root nodes, instead of a single one.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in Version 0.9.397 (2012 July 26)</h2>

<ul>
<li> New unique table.
</li>
<li> New iterator implementation for dd_edge class.
</li>
<li> Using fine-grained identity reduction rules.
</li>
<li> Lots of code reorganization and cleanup.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>SIMPLE INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> Iterators have been replaced with enumerators.
The old code segment
      <pre>
      for (dd_edge::const_iterator i = e.begin(); i; ++i) 
      </pre>
      should be replaced by
      <pre>
      for (enumerator i(e); i; ++i) 
      </pre>
      and most other <tt>iterator</tt> functionality has been included 
      in the <tt>enumerator</tt> class.
</li>
<li> Removed <tt>findFirstElement</tt> methods,
the same behavior can be obtained with enumerators.
</li>
<li> Removed <tt>createSubmatrix</tt> methods,
the same behavior can be obtained with the cross product
and intersection operators.
</ul>

<h4>EXPERT INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> Added <tt>node_builder</tt> subclass, updated operations to use it.
    This is the mechanism to use for building new nodes.
</li>
<li> Added <tt>node_reader</tt> subclass, updated operations to use it.
    This is the mechanism to use for reading nodes in a forest.
</li>
<li> Removed most of the old interface for accessing nodes.
</li>
<li> Removed temporary edges.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in Version 0.8.311 (2012 June 18)</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Improved documentation generation (automatically updates library version number).
</li>
<li>  Added complete technical documentation under a new <tt>docs-devel</tt> directory.
</li>
<li>  Reorganized forest class hierarchy, in directory <tt>src/forests</tt>.
</li>
<li>  More thorough library cleanup in <tt>MEDDLY::cleanup()</tt>.
</li>
<li>  New version of <tt>MULTIPLY</tt> identifies more terminal cases.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>

<ul>
<li>  Policy settings for a forest are now specified when the forest
      is constructed.
      The old code segment
      <pre>
      forest *f = d->createForest(false, forest::BOOLEAN,
        forest::MULTI_TERMINAL);
      f->setReductionRule(forest::FULLY_REDUCED);
      f->setNodeStorage(forest::FULL_OR_SPARSE_STORAGE);
      f->setNodeDeletion(forest::PESSIMISTIC_DELETION);
      </pre>
      can be replaced by
      <pre>
      forest::policies fp(false); // false: not a relation
      fp.setFullyReduced();
      fp.setCompactStorage();
      fp.setPessimistic();
      forest *f = d->createForest(false, forest::BOOLEAN,
        forest::MULTI_TERMINAL, fp);
      </pre>
      The default settings for the forest::policies struct 
      may be found by examining the header file <tt>meddly.h</tt>,
      and of course it is only necessary to specify a desired
      policy that differs from its default.
      Alternatively, a forest may be created using
      <pre>
      forest *f = d->createForest(false, forest::BOOLEAN,
        forest::MULTI_TERMINAL);
      </pre>
      which will use the library-wide default policies,
      based on whether the new forest is a relation or not.
      The library-wide defaults, if not specified, 
      will be equal to the default <tt>forest::policies</tt>
      initialization;
      otherwise, they may be changed by adjusting
      <tt>mddDefaults</tt> and <tt>mxdDefaults</tt>
      in <tt>MEDDLY::settings</tt> (in the expert interface)
      before the library is initialized.
</li>

<li>  In class <tt>domain</tt>,
      old methods <tt>getVar</tt> and <tt>readVar</tt>
      are changed to <tt>useVar</tt> and <tt>getVar</tt>, for consistency.
</li>

<li>  Added a better statistics mechanism for forests.
      The old interface is stil present, for compatability.
      More information may be obtained using
      <tt>forest::getStats()</tt>.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>New in version 0.7.254 (2011 July 15)</h2>

<ul>
<li>  No changes to the simple interface.
</li>
<li>  The compute table class is now visible in the expert interface.
      This should allow operations to be defined outside the library
      and still use the built-in compute tables.
</li>
<li>  The compute table mechanism has been redesigned
      and reimplemented.
      The compute table interface has changed significantly;
      this will affect anyone who implements their own operations.
</li>
<li>  Different compute tables may be selected at library
      initialization time.
</li>
<li>  Some of the globally visible functions and macros
      have been renamed or moved into the MEDDLY namespace
      to avoid conflicts.
</li>
<li>  Several example applications run faster now.
      This resolves the known issue under version 0.6.233.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.6.233 (2011 July 05)</h2>

<h4>CHANGES TO THE SIMPLE INTERFACE</h4>
<ul>
<li>  The compute manager class has been removed; 
      all its functionality has been moved to
      the <tt>MEDDLY</tt> namespace.
      For example, the old code segment
      <pre>
      compute_manager* CM = getComputeManager();
      CM->apply(compute_manager::UNION, x, y, z);
      </pre>
      can be replaced by
      <pre>
      apply(UNION, x, y, z);
      </pre>
</li>
<li>  The types of the operation codes (e.g., <tt>UNION</tt>)
      have changed.
      Most applications should not be affected by this;
      however, the change <em>is</em> visible to the simple interface.
</li>
<li>  A call to <tt>MEDDLY::cleanup()</tt> will automatically
      destroy any remaining domains, forests, or other objects
      created by MEDDLY.
      (This <em>known issue</em> listed under version 0.5
      seems to be resolved.)
</li>
<li>  A few operation names have changed: 
      old <tt>MIN</tt> is now <tt>MINIMUM</tt>
      and old <tt>MAX</tt> is now <tt>MAXIMUM</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>CHANGES TO THE EXPERT INTERFACE</h4>
<ul>
<li>  Operation codes are now classes instead of an enumerated type.
      Each operation knows its own name and how to build an operation
      for specified forests (more on that, below).
</li>
<li>  The old <tt>operation</tt> and <tt>op_info</tt> classes
      have been merged together into a new <tt>operation</tt> class.
      Each instance of <tt>operation</tt> is tied to specific forests.
</li>
<li>  There are <tt>operation</tt> subclasses for unary, binary, 
      and numerical operations.
      A numerical operation is tied to specific forest <em>edges</em>.
</li>
<li>  Numerical operations have moved to the expert interface,
      and are accessed as follows.
      Old code:
      <pre>
        // preprocessing
        compute_manager* CM = getComputeManager();
        // ...
        // critical
        CM->vectorMatrixMultiply(y, y_ind, x, x_ind, A);
      </pre>
      New code:
      <pre>
        // preprocessing
        numerical_operation* VM = VECT_MATR_MULT->buildOperation(y_ind, A, x_ind);
        // ...
        // critical
        VM->compute(y, x);
      </pre>
</li>
<li>  Users may define their own operations in user space,
      and initialize them with the same mechanism as the
      built-in operations.
      To do this:
      <ol>
      <li> Derive a class from <tt>op_initializer</tt>
           and implement the required virtual functions.  </li>
      <li> Insert your initializer into the instance of
            <tt>settings</tt> used to initialize the library.
            If you want to initialize the builtin operations,
            you should use something like <pre>
          MEDDLY::settings s;
          s.operationBuilder = new my_initializer(s.operationBuilder);
          MEDDLY::initialize(s);
          </pre>
      </li>
      <li> Your initializer's <tt>initChain</tt>
           method will be called during the call to
           <tt>MEDDLY::initialize(s);</tt>
      </li>
      <li>  Your initializer's <tt>cleanupChain</tt>
            method will ne called during the call to
            <tt>MEDDLY::cleanup();</tt>
      </li>
      </ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>KNOWN ISSUES</h4>
<ul>
<li>  The current compute table is not as fast as the old one for some operations.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.5.186 (2011 June 16)</h2>

<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>  Variables in domains are represented by
      instances of class <tt>variable</tt>, instead of integers.
      The same variable may appear in more than one domain.
</li>

<li>  Domain levels are always in the order: topmost, &hellip;, 2, 1, 0
      where level 0 is for terminal nodes.
      As such, level mapping is no longer necessary.
</li>

<li>  For convenience, there is a new function
      <pre>
      MEDDLY::createDomainBottomUp(&hellip;)
      </pre>
      which combines domain creation and variable initialization.
</li>

<li>  There are new functions to destroy objects,
      <pre>
      MEDDLY::destroyDomain(&hellip;)
      MEDDLY::destroyForest(&hellip;)
      </pre>
      and these must be used instead of <tt>delete</tt>.
</li>

</ul>

<h4>KNOWN ISSUES</h4>
<ul>
<li>  Calling <tt>MEDDLY::cleanup()</tt> can sometimes cause 
      a segmentation fault.
      Destroying all domains before calling <tt>cleanup()</tt>
      seems to fix this.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.4.174 (2011 June 13)</h2>
<h4>CHANGES TO THE SIMPLE INTERFACE</h4>
<ul>

<li> Functions and classes are now contained in a <tt>MEDDLY</tt> 
namespace. 
</li>
<br>
<li> Top-level functions named <tt>MEDDLY_function</tt> 
have been renamed as <tt>function</tt>.  
For example,
<tt>
MEDDLY_createDomain()
</tt>
can now be called as
<tt>
MEDDLY::createDomain()</tt>,
or as
<tt>
createDomain()
</tt>
inside a <tt>using namespace MEDDLY</tt> block.
</li>
<br>
<li>
There is a single, centralized <tt>error</tt> class.
All methods that previously returned <tt>error</tt>
now return <tt>void</tt>,
and any errors are passed back to the user using <tt>throw</tt>.
For example, the old code fragment
<pre>
  domain::error e = dom-&gt;createVariablesBottomUp(vars, N); 
  if (e != domain::SUCCESS) { 
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: %s\n&quot;, domain::getErrorCodeName(e)); 
    exit(1); 
  } 
</pre>
now becomes
<pre>
  try { 
    dom-&gt;createVariablesBottomUp(vars, N); 
  } 
  catch (MEDDLY::error e) { 
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: %s\n&quot;, e.getName()); 
    exit(1); 
  } 
</pre>
</li>

<li> The library must be initialized before use.
(Most operations will fail and throw an appropriate error, otherwise.)
This can be done via 
<pre>
  MEDDLY::initialize(); 
</pre>
</tt><br>
which uses default settings.
To use different settings: 
<pre>
  MEDDLY::settings s; 
  // change members of s here; 
  // the constructor will fill everything with default values so 
  // it is only necessary to specify the non-default values. 
  MEDDLY::initialize(s); <br>
</pre>
</li>

<li> <tt>compute_manager::setHashTablePolicy()</tt> has been
removed, as this functionality is now provided using the appropriate
settings during library initialization.
</li>
<br>
<li> Library memory may be released using 
<pre>
  MEDDLY::cleanup(); 
</pre>
Most operations will fail and throw an appropriate error after
<tt>cleanup()</tt> is called.
If desired, the library may be initialized again.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.3.165 (2011 June 08)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Added row-wise and column-wise iterators for Matrix Diagrams.</li>
<li> Iterators can now return the terminal value of the corresponding
minterm.</li>
<br>
<li> Added (basic) vector matrix multiplication operations.</li>
<br>
<li> Improved batch addition of minterms based on Radix Sort (speed).</li>
<li> Added mechanism for building temporary nodes.</li>
<li> Added another option for batch addition of minterms based on
temporary nodes.</li>
<br>
<li> Added reverse reachability (all states that can reach a given set of
states using a given next-state function).</li>
<li> Added the traditional reachability algorithm and a saturation-based
algorithm for reverse reachability.</li>
<br>
<li> Added test directory and files for <tt>make check</tt>.</li>
<li> Reorganization of source files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.2.101 (2010 June 11)</h2>
<ul>
<li>First tarball release</li>
<li>CTL model checking functionality is complete
(some advanced features are still in development)
</ul>
