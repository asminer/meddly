Building the library:
---------------------

You will need g++, autoconf, automake and libtool.
Do either (1a) or (1b), followed by the remaining steps.


1a. $ developers/Config_generic.sh
    or
    $ developers/Config_generic.sh --debug
    to create and run the configure script, and build the Makefiles.

1b. Run
    $ ./autogen.sh
    to create the configure script. This should be run for the
    first build, and whenever the source code files or layout changes.
    Then, run
    $ ./configure
    This will setup the build files.
    Can be used to set various compile options;
    see "Configuration Options" below.
    An alternate would be:
    $ ./configure --prefix=/other/install/location
    (See "make install" further down for reasons).



2.  $ make
    Build the library.
    Library will be in src/. Applications in src/ and examples/. This may be
    sufficient for most users.

3.  $ make install
    Library in lib/, include files in include/.  This can be changed
    in step (1) by selecting an alternate location, for example using
        --prefix=/usr/local
    will install libraries in /usr/local/lib and headers in /usr/local/include.
    If you reconfigure, make sure you run "make clean" before running "make".

4.  $ make uninstall
    Removes the files installed in bin/ and lib/.

5.  $ make clean
    Removes the results of compilation from src/ and examples/.

Build the documentation:
------------------------

0.  Need to have doxygen installed.

1.  $ cd doxygen

2.  If you see doxygen/html/index.html and doxygen/refman.pdf, your docs have
    already been built and you can ignore the rest of the steps. Otherwise:
    $ make
    This will create the folders doxygen/html and doxygen/latex.
    doxygen/html: HTML documentation. See index.html.
    doxygen/latex: Tex-based documentation. See refman.tex.
    If you have latex installed:
    a.  $ cd latex
    b.  $ make
        This will create refman.dvi.
    c.  $ make pdf
        This will create refman.pdf (using ps2pdf).

3.  $ make clean
    Removes doxygen/ and html/.

4.  Technical documentation can be generated the same way, in doxygen-devel/

Configuration Options
---------------------
Several environment variables may be set before running configure.
For example, to build a version of the library with support for
Extensible Decision Diagrams (XDDs):

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DUSE_XDDS"

To build an optimized version of the library:

$ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-O3"

To build a debuggable version of the library:

$ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-ggdb -DDEVELOPMENT_CODE"

To set the location of the gmp library, by hand
(only necessary if ./configure fails to find it):

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/gmp/header" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/gmp/lib"

To disable gmp support in Meddly:

$ ./configure --without-gmp
