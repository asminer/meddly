This release is primarily for bug fixes and to get a stable release
out before a number of significant interface changes planned for
this summer.

### Simple Interface Changes

* Under forest policies, you can now decide (at runtime) to use
  reference counts or mark and sweep for garbage collection.
  The current default is to use reference counts.
  Set ```useReferenceCounts``` to false to instead use mark and sweep.

### Expert Interface Changes

* More compact (and dynamic) node header implementation.

### Implementation

* Some bug fixes.
