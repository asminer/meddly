* Added row-wise and column-wise iterators for Matrix Diagrams.
* Iterators can now return the terminal value of the corresponding minterm.

* Added (basic) vector matrix multiplication operations.

* Improved batch addition of minterms based on Radix Sort (speed).
* Added mechanism for building temporary nodes.
* Added another option for batch addition of minterms based on
temporary nodes.

* Added reverse reachability (all states that can reach a given set of
states using a given next-state function).
* Added the traditional reachability algorithm and a saturation-based
algorithm for reverse reachability.

* Added test directory and files for ```make check```.
* Reorganization of source files.
