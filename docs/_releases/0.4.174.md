* Functions and classes are now contained in a ```MEDDLY``` namespace. 

* Top-level functions named ```MEDDLY_function```
have been renamed as ```function```.  
For example,
```MEDDLY_createDomain()```
can now be called as
```MEDDLY::createDomain()```,
or as
```createDomain()```
inside a ```using namespace MEDDLY``` block.


* There is a single, centralized  ```error```   class.
All methods that previously returned  ```error```  
now return  ```void```,
and any errors are passed back to the user using  ```throw```.
For example, the old code fragment
```c++
  domain::error e = dom->createVariablesBottomUp(vars, N); 
  if (e != domain::SUCCESS) { 
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", domain::getErrorCodeName(e)); 
    exit(1); 
  } 
```
now becomes
```c++
  try { 
    dom->createVariablesBottomUp(vars, N); 
  } 
  catch (MEDDLY::error e) { 
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", e.getName()); 
    exit(1); 
  } 
```

* The library must be initialized before use.
(Most operations will fail and throw an appropriate error, otherwise.)
This can be done via 
```c++
  MEDDLY::initialize(); 
```
which uses default settings.
To use different settings: 
```c++
  MEDDLY::settings s; 
  // change members of s here; 
  // the constructor will fill everything with default values so 
  // it is only necessary to specify the non-default values. 
  MEDDLY::initialize(s); 
```

* ```compute_manager::setHashTablePolicy()``` has been
removed, as this functionality is now provided using the appropriate
settings during library initialization.


* Library memory may be released using 
```c++
  MEDDLY::cleanup(); 
```
Most operations will fail and throw an appropriate error after
```cleanup()```   is called.
If desired, the library may be initialized again.
