### Simple Interface Changes

* More careful and more strict use of ```set``` methods in class ```dd_edge```:
    for multi-terminal forests, use ```set``` with a single argument; for
    edge-valued forsts, use the appropriate two-argument version of ```set```.
* Added new edge labeling possiblity, ```INDEX_SET```.
    From now on, this should be used instead of ```EVPLUS``` whenever an
    indexed set is constructed with operation ```CONVERT_TO_INDEX_SET```,
    otherwise the library will throw an exception.
* Added operations ```VM_MULTIPLY```, ```MV_MULTIPLY``` and ```MM_MULTIPLY```
    for MTMxDs.
* Changed design of the ```enumerator``` class.
    Regular enumerators can be initialized as usual (constructor with a
    ```dd_edge```).  Otherwise, use a constructor (or initialize later) by
    passing the enumeration type and forest.  Note that now, the forest for an
    enumerator is fixed for its life.
* Added support for EV*MxDs.
* Added mechanism to log forest changes to a file,
    to be utilized by other utilities (see class ```logger``` within class
    ```forest```).
* Cleaned up the header file.


### Expert Interface Changes

* Added classes ```int_EVencoder``` and ```float_EVencoder```
      for a centralized mechanism for storing edge values within nodes.
* Classes ```bool_encoder```, ```int_encoder```, and
      ```float_encoder``` have been renamed ```bool_Tencoder```,
      ```int_Tencoder```, and ```float_Tencoder``` for consistency.
* Vector-matrix and matrix-vector multiply can now use
       ```INDEX_SET``` or ```EVPLUS``` forests.
       Currently, it is better to use ```INDEX_SET```
       forests if possible.
* Changed names ```VECT_MATR_MULT``` and ```MATR_VECT_MULT```,
      to ```EXPLVECT_MATR_MULT``` and ```MATR_EXPLVECT_MULT```,
      to emphasize that vectors are stored explicitly.
* Completely re-designed the compute table interface.
      Large impact on implementation of operations;
      little to no impact on everything else.
      The new interface completely hides the compute table
      storage mechanism, so we will be able to plug in different
      storage schemes without changing any operation code
      (at least, in theory).
      Part of the gradual shift toward 64-bit node handles.
* Class ```numerical_operation``` is removed and should be
      replaced by ```specialized_operation```.
* Added a ```specialized_operation``` for saturation,
       which allows the use of partitioned transition relations
       with options for organizing and combining them.
       See class ```satpregen_opname```,
       and ```SATURATION_FORWARD```.
* Cleaned up the header file.


### Implementation Changes

* New implementation of ```COPY```.
        It should now be possible to copy between almost any two 
        forests over the same domain
        (assuming they are either both for sets, or both for relations).
* Added test applications for ```COPY```, and EV*MxDs.
