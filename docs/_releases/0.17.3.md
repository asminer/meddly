### Interface Changes

Uncomment ```ALLOW_DEPRECATED_0_17_3``` in ```defines.h```
to use these deprecated methods.
This is intended to help developers migrate to the new interface.

* Moved ```node_headers``` inner classes to ```arrays.h```

* Created ```node_marker``` object, for mark and sweep
    (or just various mark applications).

* Created ```dot_maker``` object in ```io_dot.h```,
    for creating dot files from MDDs.

* Methods ```expert_forest::writeNodeGraphPicture```
    and ```dd_edge::writePicture```
    are now deprecated; use object ```dot_maker``` instead.

* Created ```mdd_writer``` and ```mdd_reader``` objects in ```io_mdds.h```,
    for reading and writing MDDs in an exchange format.

* Methods ```forest::writeEdges```
    and ```forest::readEdges```
    are now deprecated; use objects ```mdd_writer``` and ```mdd_reader``` instead.


* Removed several inlined forest methods related to policy decisions
    (reordering policiy, how to store nodes) as these can be obtained
    almost as easily using ```forest::getPolicy().someOtherInlinedMethod()```.

* Removed method ```forest::useDomain()```, use ```forest::getDomain()```
    (now overloaded) instead.

* Moved reporting flags (```HUMAN_READABLE_MEMORY```, ```BASIC_STATS```,
    ```EXTRA_STATS```, ```FOREST_STATS```, ```STORAGE_STATS```,
    ```STORAGE_DETAILED```, ```UNIQUE_TABLE_STATS```,
    ```UNIQUE_TABLE_DETAILED```, ```HOLE_MANAGER_STATS```,
    ```HOLE_MANAGER_DETAILED```)
    out of ```expert_forest``` and into ```policies.h```.

* Moved display flags (```SHOW_TERMINALS```, ```SHOW_INDEX```,
    ```SHOW_DETAILS```, ```SHOW_UNREACHABLE```, ```SHOW_DELETED```)
    out of ```expert_forest``` and into ```policies.h```.

* Moved several methods and members from ```expert_forest``` to ```forest```.

### Implementation

Slightly faster node marking implementation.
