* No changes to the simple interface.
* The compute table class is now visible in the expert interface.
  This should allow operations to be defined outside the library
  and still use the built-in compute tables.
* The compute table mechanism has been redesigned
  and reimplemented.
  The compute table interface has changed significantly;
  this will affect anyone who implements their own operations.
* Different compute tables may be selected at library
  initialization time.
* Some of the globally visible functions and macros
  have been renamed or moved into the MEDDLY namespace
  to avoid conflicts.
* Several example applications run faster now.
  This resolves the **known issue** under version 0.6.233.
