### Interface Changes

This release mainly changes the file layout.
Header file ```meddly.h```
is now an umbrella header,
and implementation is further divided out into
header and implementation files.
Mostly the interface itself is unchanged, with a few exceptions.

* Header file ```meddly_expert.h```
    has been eliminated.

* Necessary header files will be installed under
    ```(prefix)/include/meddly```,
    instead of
    ```(prefix)/include```.


* Class ```expert_variable``` has been merged into class ```variable```.
    It is anticipated that other simple and expert versions
    of classes will be merged in future releases.

* Operation names (COMPLEMENT, CARDINALITY, etc.)
    have changed type;
    they are now functions of no parameters,
    that return an operation name.

* Several enums, structs, and classes that were within
    other classes, have become stand-alone (top-level)
    enum classes, structs, or classes.
