### Simple Interface Changes

* Added ```const``` to array of terminal values,
  in parameter to ```createEdgeForVar``` methods.
  This should have minimal, if any, impact on applications.
* Added constants ```DONT_CARE```
  and ```DONT_CHANGE```,
  which should be used instead of raw values,
  for calls to ```createEdge()``` methods.
  In particular, ```DONT_CHANGE``` should **NOT**
  be used for unprimed levels.

### Expert Interface Changes

The mechanism for encoding and decoding terminal nodes
(for multi-terminal forests) has been changed.
The following methods of ```expert_forest``` were removed:
  * ```getBoolean()```
  * ```getInteger()```
  * ```getReal()```
  * ```getTerminalNode()``` 
  * ```isValidTerminalValue()```

Terminal encoding is now handled by classes ```bool_encoder```,
```int_encoder```, and ```float_encoder```
inside ```expert_forest```, allowing the use of templates if desired.
The following methods have been added for convenience:
  * ```handleForValue()``` 
  * ```getValueFromHandle()``` 
  * ```getBooleanFromHandle()``` 
  * ```getIntegerFromHandle()``` 
  * ```getRealFromHandle()``` 

### Implementation Changes
  * Reorganized (and reimplemented) mutli-terminal hierarchy
  * A few bug fixes
