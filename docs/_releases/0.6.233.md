### Changes to the simple interface

* The compute manager class has been removed; 
  all its functionality has been moved to
  the ```MEDDLY```   namespace.
  For example, the old code segment
  ```c++
  compute_manager* CM = getComputeManager();
  CM->apply(compute_manager::UNION, x, y, z);
  ```
  can be replaced by
  ```c++
  apply(UNION, x, y, z);
  ```   

* The types of the operation codes (e.g.,  ```UNION```)
  have changed.
  Most applications should not be affected by this;
  however, the change *is* visible to the simple interface.
* A call to  ```MEDDLY::cleanup()```   will automatically
  destroy any remaining domains, forests, or other objects
  created by MEDDLY.
  (This **known issue** listed under version 0.5
  seems to be resolved.)
* A few operation names have changed: 
  old ```MIN```   is now  ```MINIMUM``` and 
  old ```MAX```   is now  ```MAXIMUM```.


### Changes to the expert interface 

* Operation codes are now classes instead of an enumerated type.
  Each operation knows its own name and how to build an operation
  for specified forests (more on that, below).
* The old <tt>operation</tt> and <tt>op_info</tt> classes
  have been merged together into a new <tt>operation</tt> class.
  Each instance of <tt>operation</tt> is tied to specific forests.
* There are <tt>operation</tt> subclasses for unary, binary, 
  and numerical operations.
  A numerical operation is tied to specific forest <em>edges</em>.
* Numerical operations have moved to the expert interface,
  and are accessed as follows.
  Old code:
  ```c++
  // preprocessing
  compute_manager* CM = getComputeManager();
  // ...
  // critical
  CM->vectorMatrixMultiply(y, y_ind, x, x_ind, A);
  ```
  New code:
  ```c++
  // preprocessing
  numerical_operation* VM = VECT_MATR_MULT->buildOperation(y_ind, A, x_ind);
  // ...
  // critical
  VM->compute(y, x);
  ```

* Users may define their own operations in user space,
  and initialize them with the same mechanism as the
  built-in operations.
  To do this:
    1. Derive a class from  ```op_initializer```  
       and implement the required virtual functions.  
    2. Insert your initializer into the instance of
       ```settings``` used to initialize the library.
       If you want to initialize the builtin operations,
       you should use something like 
       ```c++
       MEDDLY::settings s;
       s.operationBuilder = new my_initializer(s.operationBuilder);
       MEDDLY::initialize(s);
       ```
    3. Your initializer's ```initChain``` method will be 
       called during the call to ```MEDDLY::initialize(s);```
    4. Your initializer's ```cleanupChain``` method will be 
       called during the call to ```MEDDLY::cleanup();```


### Known Issues
* The current compute table is not as fast as the old one for some operations.
