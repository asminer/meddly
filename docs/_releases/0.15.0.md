We have changed the release numbering system,
because the repository has moved to git and
the old version numbering system was based on the Subversion revision number.

### Simple Interface Changes

* New (experimental) method, ```dd_edge::writePicture```,
  generates a visualization of the decision diagram.
  You must have 
  [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org)
  installed for this to work.


### Expert Interface Changes

* Various improvements and extensions to Saturation implementation.


### Implementation Changes

* Moved ```node_headers``` out of ```expert_forest```.
* Node header now includes incoming count.
* Separated memory management out of node storage,
    into its own style that can be set at runtime.
* Error class now tracks filename and line number
    of source code that threw the error.
* Updated garbage collection of compute table entries.
    Compute table entry status is now one of: dead, recoverable, active.
* Support for *extensible* variables:
    - To enable, give the variable a negative bound  
    - Can mix extensible and non-extensible variables in the same domain 
    - Supported in multi-terminal forests for sets and relations 
    - Compatible with Apply operations and saturation
