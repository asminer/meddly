title: New in Version 0.8.311
number: 0.8.311
date: 2012-06-18

* Improved documentation generation 
  (automatically updates library version number).
* Added complete technical documentation under a new ```docs-devel``` directory.
* Reorganized forest class hierarchy, in directory ```src/forests```.
* More thorough library cleanup in ```MEDDLY::cleanup()```.
* New version of ```MULTIPLY``` identifies more terminal cases.


### Interface Changes

* Policy settings for a forest are now specified when the forest
  is constructed.
  The old code segment
  ```c++
  forest *f = d->createForest(false, forest::BOOLEAN, forest::MULTI_TERMINAL);
  f->setReductionRule(forest::FULLY_REDUCED);
  f->setNodeStorage(forest::FULL_OR_SPARSE_STORAGE);
  f->setNodeDeletion(forest::PESSIMISTIC_DELETION);
  ```
  can be replaced by
  ```c++
  forest::policies fp(false); // false: not a relation
  fp.setFullyReduced();
  fp.setCompactStorage();
  fp.setPessimistic();
  forest *f = d->createForest(false, forest::BOOLEAN, forest::MULTI_TERMINAL, fp);
  ```
  The default settings for the ```forest::policies``` struct 
  may be found by examining the header file ```meddly.h```,
  and of course it is only necessary to specify a desired
  policy that differs from its default.
  Alternatively, a forest may be created using
  ```c++
  forest *f = d->createForest(false, forest::BOOLEAN, forest::MULTI_TERMINAL);
  ```
  which will use the library-wide default policies,
  based on whether the new forest is a relation or not.
  The library-wide defaults, if not specified, 
  will be equal to the default ```forest::policies```
  initialization;
  otherwise, they may be changed by adjusting
  ```mddDefaults``` and ```mxdDefaults```
  in ```MEDDLY::settings``` (in the expert interface)
  before the library is initialized.

* In class ```domain```,
  old methods ```getVar``` and ```readVar```
  are changed to ```useVar``` and ```getVar```, for consistency.

* Added a better statistics mechanism for forests.
  The old interface is stil present, for compatability.
  More information may be obtained using
  ```forest::getStats()```.
