Plan for this branch (testing after each big step):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Switch to minimalist dd_edges

    (*) forests need to implement addRoot and removeRoot
        reference counting: just link, unlink nodes
        mark & sweep: conceptually, an array of 'root counts'
            for each node; will be sparse though.  (use std::map)

    (*) binary operators +=, &=, etc
        just call apply


(2) Add method

        forest::reduceUnpacked(unpacked_node *un, dd_edge &e);

    maybe virtual (if derived classes handle edges differently?)


(3) Unpacked nodes become arrays of dd_edges

(4) Apply implementations use dd_edges

(5) Compute tables use dd_edges
